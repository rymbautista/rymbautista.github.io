          <h2>Overview and usage</h2>
          <b>
            This is a game called Frapple that utilizes p5 and p5.play to create a game about a frog that catches apples falling from the sky.
          <br>

          <h2>Development Process</h2> 
          <h3>Ideation</h3> 
          The development process started actually with a build of frogger that I found online. Although this had a great foundation for a game, I found that
          I was built weirdly that it was very hard coded to the dimensions that it originally had, so I pivoted to a game where apples fall from the sky and 
          the player controls the frog with their mouse to catch these apples. 
          <h3>The Sprites</h3>
          The first thing I played with was creating sprites. I made the frog sprite first having it only move with the mouse and only left and right. Then I started to play with the falling objects. After getting one
          fall from the middle of the screen I was able to get them to randomly spawn from one of the set spawn points with different velocities.

          <h3>Having them interact</h3> 
          After constructing the sprites I used overlap to check if they would intersect and if it did the player's score would go up, and then had it so that if the objects
          fell lower than the floor the player would lose a life. If they lost 3 the game was over.
          <h3>Restart</h3>
          The last function that I added was making the 'R' key on the keyboard restart the game for a game over if the user wanted to just restart. This 
          led to me using an if statement for checking if the 'R' key has been pressed and then resetting the values to their default and clearing the array
          of apple objects that were currently falling. 
          <h3>Making it look Pretty</h3> 
          One of the last steps after implementing all the functional components of my game was making the game look more pretty. I created images of frogs and apples 
          for the catcher and object sprites. I then started by adding background elements like the floor and a bar at the top, then I added an image of the hills in the back to fill the sky. Lastly, I added a box around the game over screen
          for readability.
          <h2>Issues</h2> 
          <h3>Deploying to git hub pages</h3>
          The biggest roadblock I faced was getting over the hurdle of deploying to git hub pages. This was mainly to small things in my code and missing files 
          when doing the rollup. I was able to successfully deploy it after being pointed to some discord posts and some spot-checking of my code from Hannah. 
          <h3>Getting the hang of p5.play</h3>
          One of the things I did struggle a tiny bit with was just learning how p5.play works and getting it to interact with p5 it just took me a bit of time to see
          how it can interact. I found that the references on the website were really helpful for learning about how these libraries work.

          <h2>Ideas and Future</h2> 
            <ul>
              <li>A bit more cleaned-up graphics</li>
              <li>Add animations to the apples falling and the frog moving</li>
              <li>Implement Sounds for then the player collects an apple and loses</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>Kudos</h2> 
          I would like to thank Han for helping me think about how to go about making some of my game, then I would also like to thank Max and Hwa Jung for helping me with the initial set up of my game.

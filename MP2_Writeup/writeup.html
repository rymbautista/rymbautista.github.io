          <h2>Overview and usage</h2>
          <b>
            This creative code gallery was an exploration of P5 and its powerful visual/audio creation and interaction capabilities.

          <h2>Development Process</h2> 
          <h3>Static, Interactive, and Loop</h3> 
          The development process started with trying to make a frog. This process started with making one in the corner and getting the
          basics about shapes and layering. I also implemented a nested for loop to create a pattern of lilypads. After that, I learned more about Positioning and translating them. I ended up making a version
          of my frog was centered that became the foundation for many of my other sketches. After making the static frog I made the 
          Interactive frog where I was able to use the mouseX and MouseY to draw where one point of a line, tongue, and a circle where
          to have it look like the tongue is following a fly where the mouse is. Then I moved on to the infinite loop where I was able to repurpose
          an example where a rectangle was rotating at the center of the page. I positioned my statice frog in the middle and then I created lilypads
          that surrounded it and rotated around it.

          <h3>Random</h3> 
          Taking a step away from frogs I made a flower that would change pedal/pot size and shape by utilizing random boundaries bounded to
          ranges very close to when I first made the flower. This made it so that parts of the flower were in a fixed position but certain points moved
          around to vary the features of the flowers while keeping the general flower shape.

            src="/gallery/images/RandomGif.gif" alt="Gif of the flower changing randomly in sizes"/>  
          <h3>Audio and Audio Visual</h3> 
          After receiving help from Han and one of the examples for audio I was able to make a piece that would play the whopper song from a 
          currently trending Burger King commercial. When the page is clicked the song will play and a whopper will appear when clicked again 
          would stop the song while leaving only the plate behind. The Audio Visual piece was based on the rainbow keyboard example and reused elements
          from the infinite loop and interactive frog to have lilypads that would play a note and change color while having a gro stick its tongue out 
          and eat a fly.

          <h3>Setting up the Gallery</h3> 
          Next, I set up my gallery. I repurposed the code for my home page as it already had a gallery-like layout that would well. I then imported 
          my code and linked everything together.
          <h3>Adjustments</h3> 
          After implementing my pieces into my website I viewed and made changes to some of the pieces based on how they were displayed on an actual 
          web page as it was different than the web editor preview.
          <h2>Issues</h2> 
          <h3>Learning to draw in P5</h3>
          The biggest roadblock I faced was getting over the hurdle of drawing in P5 it a while to understand how positions work and constantly looked
           at the reference sheet to see if I missed any inputs. Although I still struggle with them I have a better understanding of how to draw thanks 
           to practicing.
          <h3>push and pop</h3>
          One of the things I did not understand was how push and pop worked, but after watching a youtube video, mentioned in the kudos below. 
          I was able to figure out that push and pop needed to be used one after the other to chunk a piece to be separately affected from other 
          components when for example translating.
          <h3>Positioning  and Sizing</h3>
          One issue I had when I brought my files outside of the editor was having a real grasp of the sizing as the tiny window in the editor did a
           good job for most of my pieces some did not do well. It just required me to go back and forth between reloading the code to see how it does in 
           different screen sizes
          <br> 
          <h2>Ideas and Future</h2> 
            <ul>
              <li>Have more pieces with better backgrounds</li>
              <li>Add a button that will randomize the Flower</li>
              <li>More lily pads to surround the loop frog</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>Kudos</h2> 
          I would like to thank Han for helping me figure out how to import and use audio. Also, shout out to The Coding Train 
          for teaching me about push and pop.

            <span class="caption">Code that initializes the use of pins 13,7,6,5, and 4 as outputs, 9 as a to the servo object 2 as an input pullup. 
              This code first does a calibration to find the max and min values of the joystick moving in the x and y ranges of the joystick. Then it 
              constrains and maps these values to the range of 0 to 180 to fit with the values the servo takes in. This code causes a light to turn on 
              and the servo to move to 180 degrees when the switch button is pressed. Then when the joystick is moved in the x direction the servo will 
              move and then a blue or green light will turn on when it is moved down or up away from neutral respectively. Then a red or yellow light 
              will move and turn on similarly but with respect to when the joystick is moved in the y direction.

          <h2>üßÆ Calculations and Schematic üìÑ</h2>
          For calculations for the LEDs, I utilized Ohm's law (V=IR) to calculate the minimum amount of resistance to use. The computer outputs 5V (V=5)
           and a red, yellow, and green LED causes a drop of 1.8V and a blue with 3.3V. Then from the Datasheet document, the max amount of current 
           for the LEDs should be .03MA so I used .02A to be safe. Now that I have the variables for solving for the resistance needed I solved it 
           and found that R = 160Œ© for red, yellow, and green while blue was R = 85Œ©. In my circuit, I decided to use 330Œ© as it was higher than the 
           minimum about of resistance needed to power the circuit.
          <br>
          For the joystick, I would normally use, a 10k Resister in my circuit. As a 10K Œ© wouldn't draw too much current when the switch is open.
           The higher the resistor the less current it will draw. But for the joystick, I used the Arduino Digital PullUp Pin feature where arduino 
           pin 2 can act as the Pullup resister and pin reader. I found that that joystick required a pullup resister instead of a pull-down by using 
           the potentiometer to see that the current flow stopped when the button was pressed.

        <h2>‚öô Technical Implamentation</h2>
          Hello Frog! Utilizes a stepper motor, stepper motor driver, potentiometer, 2 white LED bulbs, 330-ohm resistors, wires, the breadboard
          , and an Arduino powered by a 9V battery. It is encased in a laser-cut wood shell that hides the circuit and is in the shape of a frog. 
          On the back is where the stepper motor is implemented and in between the front and back panels is where the arm waves and the lights 
          are set up. Inside is where the potentiometer is placed so that the user can set it up and turn on the display and convert it back up to
          show minimal hardware.

              pins 8,9,10, and 11. Then initialize the potentiometer pin and a read value variable. Then a steps variable is made to track what stages the stepper 
              motor is currently going through. After that, we initialize the stepper motor driver pins to be out puts. Next, we go into the loop value, first taking in the
              potentiometer reading and then storing it, mapping it, and constraining it. By mapping and constraining it, we can set the range of the values to be within 
              the microsecond delay we want for setting the speed of the stepper motor. After reading we go into the if statement that reads for if the lowest value 
              is not being read, acting as an off switch. If it is not the lowest reading value we set it to go through the for loop where it will then cycle through the 
              different stages for the stepper motor to move. After going through the range for 1/3 third of the circle the motor will switch directions, going through this Loop
              over and over again for a waving back and forth motion.

          <h2>üßÆ Calculations and Schematic üìÑ</h2>
          For calculations for the two white LEDs in this circuit I utilized Ohm's law (V=IR) to calculate the minimum amount of resistance to use. The battery outputs 9V (V=9)
           and a white LED causes a drop of 3.3V Then from the Datasheet document, the max amount of current for the LEDs should be .03MA so I used .02A to be safe. Now that I have the variables for solving for the resistance needed I solved it 
           and found that R = 120Œ© for each of my two white LEDs. In my circuit, I decided to use 330Œ© for each segment as it was higher than the minimum about of resistance needed to power the circuit. Then I used 1360 within my
           for loop the stepper has 4096 steps (the value for making a full rotation) so I used a value that was approximately one third of that but divisible by 8 as the stepper needs to go through
           8 different stages to move so this makes it easier.

            A1: Blink was a challenge to use an Arduino to cause multiple bulbs to light up independently one at a time.

          <h2>üßÆ Calculations and Schematic üìÑ</h2>
          For calculations, I utilized Ohm's law (V=IR) to calculate the minimum amount of resistance to use.
          The computer outputs 5V (V=5) and a red LED causes a drop of 1.8V. Then from the Datasheet docuent the max amount of current for a red buld should be .03MA so I used .02A to be safe. 
          Now that I have the variables for solving for the resistance needed I solved it and found that R = 160Œ©. In my circuit I 
          decided to use 330Œ© as it was higher than the minimum about of resistance needed to power the circuit.

              If pressed the 9, 10, and 11 pins are turned on and through each look, the brightness goes up until it hits max

          <h2>üßÆ Calculations and Schematic üìÑ</h2>
          For calculations for the LEDs, I utilized Ohm's law (V=IR) to calculate the minimum amount of resistance to use. 
          The computer outputs 5V (V=5) and a red and green LED causes a drop of 1.8V. Then from the Datasheet document, the max 
          amount of current for a red bulb should be .03MA so I used .02A to be safe. Now that I have the variables for solving 
          for the resistance needed I solved it and found that R = 160Œ©. In my circuit, I decided to use 330Œ© as it was higher than 
          the minimum about of resistance needed to power the circuit.
          <br>
          For the button, a 10k Resister was used in my circuit. I decided to use 10K Œ© as it was higher than the minimum amount of 
          resistance and provides a way to ensure a low or high state while using a low amount of current. This allows for an open 
          circuit and when the pin is closed the pin is grounded.

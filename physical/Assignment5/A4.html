            <span class="caption">Code that utilizes capacitive touch to turn on an LED strip with the use of a transistor. 
              It sets the use of pin 2 as a sensor pin for capacitive touch and then Pin 6 as an output and starts the serial 
              monitor. Then it starts a timer to track time for debugging, then tota1 is used to store the reading from the 
              capacitive touch then we constrain the readings and then map them from 0 to 255 for an appropriate range for 
              analogWrite(). for debugging the totals are printed and then written to pin 6 for the transistor to limit the 
              power that goes through the transistor and power the LED strip.

          <h2>üßÆ Calculations and Schematic üìÑ</h2>
          For calculations for white LEDs on the strip they are bundled in groups of 3 White LEDS in series. Each white LED
           has a voltage drop of 3.3v so 3.3v*3=9.9v drop for one branch. and the resistors are marked 181 so 18*10=180Œ©. 
           So with our power supply being 12v we can solve 12v-9.9v=I*180Œ©, I = 0.011667A or 11.667mA (which is within the 
           range for the transistor) and we know it can power the LED strips safely as the power supply has a current of 
           2A so dividing that by the 0.011667A we can power about 175 branches or when multiplied by 3, about 514 LEDs. For 
           my left capacitive touch circuit, I utilized a 1MŒ© resistor because it is a good baseline that the library is calibrated to.

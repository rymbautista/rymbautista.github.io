            <span class="caption">Code that utilizes an IR Remote and Seven Segments Display library. It sets the use of pins 13,12,11,10,9.8.7, and 6, 
              as seven-segment display components and initiates 3 as the IR reading pin. This code then sets variables to readings to calibrate the 
              buttons to responses. After starting the serial monitor it begins to wait for a response from the IR Remote then when it does it checks
              if it is one of the calibrated buttons. If it is one of them it displays a response in the serial monitor and one on the seven-segment
              display. If it isn't one of the calibrates it does the same thing but also displays the reading for future calibrations and responses for the
              user to use.

          <h2>üßÆ Calculations and Schematic üìÑ</h2>
          For calculations for the red LEDs in the seven-segment display, I utilized Ohm's law (V=IR) to calculate the minimum amount of resistance to use. The computer outputs 5V (V=5)
           and a red LED causes a drop of 1.8V Then from the Datasheet document, the max amount of current for the LEDs should be .03MA so I used .02A to be safe. Now that I have the variables for solving for the resistance needed I solved it 
           and found that R = 160Œ© for red. In my circuit, I decided to use 330Œ© for each segment as it was higher than the minimum about of resistance needed to power the circuit.

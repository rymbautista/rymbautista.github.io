          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <b> 
            For my overall process, I ideated some ideas that I wanted to incorporate and scale them down to somewhat simple forms to first learn 
            about how they work. After creating the template I copied them to try and replicate new pages, learning about what is required to path 
            between different folders and HTML/CSS templates. A lot of my process was searching if a certain feature was possible and then finding 
            code that would work and trying and implement it. If I got the examples to work I would then play around with the code to see how I can implement my content. I did this by first learning how to overlay an image over another image, and then again by learning how to apply CSS transition of fading in with my title. I also utilized 
            Flexbox Froggy as a way of learning how to align the content within my webpage.

          <h2>Issues</h2> 
          One issue that I had was pushing to git hub. There was an issue where I had many unknown files that would have been pushed at the same time, so deleting them allowed me to push.
          An issue that I had was not knowing how to pathing as I wanted to have all my images inside one folder. I did some searching to find that I had to include an / followed by the file name to get to a folder outside of the current folder's scope.
          <br> 
          <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
          The CSS transition that I decided to implement was a Fade-in when you hover over the title. Since I was a beginner I decided to implement
          this transition because it was fairly simple for me to try and replicate from an example I found. It is made by making a class called fade-in-text
          and then I added a hover element to it that when a curser is over it will utalize the amaination toolkits and keyframes to change the opacity from 0% to 100%.

          <h2>Ideas and Future</h2> 
                -I would like to add a navigation bar and back buttons
            <br>-A background element in the bottom left of one of my frogs waving
            <br>-Learn more about CSS transisitons to make a jiggle animation
            <br>-More complex formatting

          <h2>Overview and usage</h2>
          <b>
            Froggy Pal is a virtual pet that allows you to take care of your own little frog. After installing You Fraoggy Pal, 
            you can click the froggy pal icon on the hot bar. Here a pop-up will appear prompting you to go to visit your froggy pal. 
            Here you meet Paul the default frog, but feel free to name them whatever your new pal will be! They also need to be fed. 
            Keep track of when they were last fed and make sure to feed them!
          <br>

          <h2>Development Process</h2> 
          <h3>Ideation</h3> 
          The development process started with thinking about what I would want this frog to look like. I had many ideas but 
          narrowed it down to being able to rename, feed the frog, and also update when the frog was fed.
          <h3>Repurposing Examples</h3> 
          To begin I built off of the e-nator example from class, it had many elements that were similar to mine. The first thing I 
          did redesigned the popup to match the aesthetic of the web extension. I then started redesigning the configuration page. 
          I added a gif of a frog I drew to make it look like a living pet. Then played around with how elements worked. 
          <img class="picture"
            src="/images/A1 snap.JPG" alt="Inprgress image of Froggy Pal" />  
          <h3>Renaming</h3> 
          After receiving help on learning how to have the HTML and Javascript talk to each other and chrome storage I was able to 
          get a text field that took the input of the user and record a new name for a user's froggy Pal.
          <h3>Feeding</h3> 
          After that, I was able to replicate and adjust the code alongside the Date() objects and their functions to allow me to take
           get the time when a user would press the button to feed their frog and update their last feed. A series of nested if
            statements were used to reformat the times that were returned to be formatted as a 12-hour PST time form instead of a 24 
            clock.
          <h3>Aesthetic Final Touches</h3> 
          After implementing all the main functions for Froggy Pal I went back and added new fonts like "Go Frog" and "Quicksand" 
          then I added and adjusted a smaller border that surrounded the Froggy Pal and then went back and touched up the popup.
          <h2>Issues</h2> 
          <h3>Learning about how Event Listener and tags worked</h3>
          The biggest roadblock I faced was with Event Listeners and tags as I was still new to them. After getting some help from 
          Hannah and Raina I had a basic understanding of how to set up these Event Listeners and used them in JS.
          <h3>If/if else/else statements</h3>
          One of the things I was trying to deal with was setting the condition to properly display the last fed time as the 
          function I used displayed hours in military time and single digits, which doesn't work for the XX:0X format, and also 
          to set am and pm. So I tried to use if and else statements I had to go to w3 to relearn about if else for multiple 
          conditions. But the biggest thing that I used was alerts to see if the conditions were flowing the right way. 
          This led me to remember nested if else where I had a group of like conditions go through another if/else statement to 
          change properly display the time.
          <h3>Formatting</h3>
          One issue I came into was not knowing what I was affecting when I was adjusting the CSS to change the page format. That's 
          when I started to use inspect as a way to specifically locate what element I was changing and it also allowed me to gain a
          grasp on what certain elements were affecting, like margins, padding, and borders.
          <br> 
          <h2>Ideas and Future</h2> 
            <ul>
              <li>Have a new gif when an action like being fed was done</li>
              <li>A random words of affirmation generator</li>
              <li>More interactions like dressing the frog up</li>
              <li>Begin able to drag food for it to eat</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>Kudos</h2> 
          I would like to thank Raina and Hannah so much for helping me to figure out how to work the event clickers and debugging the problems I encountered with Date()

          <h2>Development Process</h2> 
          <h3>Ideation</h3> 
            The development process started with thinking about what I would want this frog to look like. I had many ideas, but narrowed it down to
            being able to rename, feed the frog, and also update when the frog was fed.
          <h3>Repurposing Examples</h3> 
            To begin I built off of the e-nator example from class, it 
            had many elements that were similar to mine. The first thing I did redesigned the popup to match the asethetic of the webextension. 
            I then started redesigning the configuration page. I added a a gif of a frog I drew to make it look like a living pet. Then played
            around with how elements worked.
          <img class="picture"
            src="/images/A1 snap.JPG" />  
          <h3>Renaming</h3> 
          After recieveing help on learning how to have the html and Javascript talking I was able to get a text field which took the input of
          the user and sent in a new name for a users froggy Pal. 
          <h3>Feeding</h3> 
          After that I was able to replicate and adjust the code alongside the Date() objects and its functions to allow me to take get the time
          when a user would press the button to feed their frog and update their last fed.  
          <h3>Asethetic Final Touches</h3> 
          After implamenting all the main functions for Froggy Pal I went back and added new fonts like "Go Frog" and "Quicksand" then I 
          added abd adjusted a smaller boarder that surrounded the Froggy Pal and then went back and touched up the popup.
          <h2>Issues</h2> 
          <h3>Learning about how Event Listener and tags worked</h3>
            The biggest roadblock I faced was in reguards to Event Listeners and tags as I was still new to them. 
          <h3>If/if else/else statments</h3>
            One of the things I was tryng to deal with was setting condition to properly display the last fed time as the function I used
            displayed hours in in military time and single digits, which doesnt work for the XX:0X format, and also to set am and pm. So I tried to use if and else statments
            I had to go to w3 to relarn about if else for multiple conditions. But the biggest thing that I used was alerts to see if the conditions were
            flowing the right ways. This led me to remembering about nested if else where I had a gorup of like condiitons go through anouther 
            if/else statment to change properly display the time. 
          <h3>Formating</h3>
            One issue I came into was not really knowing what I was effecting when I was adjusting the css to changing the page format. Thats when 
            I started to use inspect as a way to specifically locate what element I was changing and it also allowed me to really gain a grasp
            on what certain element were actually effecting, like margins, padding, and borders. 
          <br> 
          <h2>Ideas and Future</h2> 
            <ul>
              <li>Have a new gif when an action like being fed was done</li>
              <li>A random words of affirmation generator</li>
              <li>More interactions like dressing the frog up</li>
              <li>Begin able to drag food for it to eat</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>Kudos</h2> 
            I would like to thank Raina and Hannah so much for helping me out to figure out how to work th eevent clickers and debuggin the probelms I encounted with Date()

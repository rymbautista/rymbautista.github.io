          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <b>
            For my prototype, I have made a frog pet simulator where you drag and drop items to help replenish the decreasing happiness bar while balancing the hunger bar
            status.

          <h3>Play my game <a href="https://rymbautista.github.io/438FinalProto/">here!</a></h3>

          <h2>Development Process</h2> 
          <h3>Mapping</h3> 
          The first thing I did was map out the placement of the assets that I will be implementing. I used basic p5 shapes to make the background. After that I made 
          the basic static sprites and ended up with the basic setting of my game.

            src="/images/FInalP1.JPG" />  
          <h3>Sprite interactions</h3> 
          The first thing that I did was make it so that the status bar's length was dependent on a variable and then made it so that the hunger bar would decrease 
          over time as well. Next, I used p5.play functions to get the frog sprite to move in a set pattern. After that, I began working on how to get the sprites to 
          interact with the fly sprite that followed the mouse. first I tested out if overlapping would be able to change the bar values. I ran into issues but with the help
          of Hannah, I was able to get the fly to interact with the fly to change the values.
          <h3>Dragging Objects</h3>
          The Final thing I implemented for this prototype is having the objects follow the mouse when the fly sprite overlaps them. I was able to get that to occur and then
          have it so that the object overlaps the frog it would change the bar value. I even added a trash sprite that will get rid of the current object the user is 
          currently holding. 
          <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2> 
          <h3>Sprits and overlap</h3> 
          The biggest issue that I incountered was being able to have the sprites interact with each other when they overlapped. With the help of Hannah we found that
          setting the inital fly location and then using mouseX and mousY caused the fly to teleport so using movetowards is much more effective and allowed for the 
          the sprites to be able to ineract when they overlapped
        <h2>Project Scope</h2>
            The scope of my project has not changed since the beginning of my proposal. The only feature that I changed was adding the trash can.
          <h2>Time management</h2>  
          I am right on track to what my inital plan was, I have all the staging done and already starting to implament the real images. The roadblock that I encountered
          was just the sprite overlapping interactions, but that was anticipated and resolved. 
         <br> 
          <h2>Implementation plan</h2> 
          My implementation plan for my final project has not changed as I am right on track.
          <h2>Kudos</h2> 
          I would like to thank Andy Shaw for helping me debug some of my issues regarding pictures, and overlapping.
